# Agent Queue

This page is generated from the canonical progress file:
`docs/content/building-gormes/architecture_plan/progress.json`.

It lists unblocked, non-umbrella contract rows that are ready for a focused
skill-driven implementation attempt. Each card carries the execution owner,
slice size, contract, trust class, degraded-mode requirement, fixture target,
write scope, test commands, done signal, acceptance checks, and source
references.

Shared skill handoff facts live in [Skill Builder Handoff](../builder-loop-handoff/):
the main skill entrypoint, plan, candidate source, generated docs, tests, and
candidate policy. Keep those control-plane facts in `meta.builder_loop`, and
keep row-specific execution facts in `progress.json`.

If the generated list is empty, do not switch to an ad hoc TODO list. Route
through `gormes-planner`, repair one planned/draft row until it satisfies the
handoff contract, validate `progress.json`, and then return to builder
selection.

## 1. Agent lifecycle hooks (agent:start, agent:step, agent:end)

- Phase: 5 / 5.O
- Owner: `gateway`
- Size: `small`
- Status: `planned`
- Priority: `P2`
- Contract: Gormes gateway hook system fires agent:start, agent:step, and agent:end HookPoints around kernel turn processing, mirroring Hermes' gateway/hooks.py agent lifecycle event types. agent:start fires when the kernel begins processing a message; agent:step fires after each tool-calling turn iteration; agent:end fires when the kernel completes processing. Hook errors during agent lifecycle events are logged but do not abort the turn.
- Trust class: system
- Ready when: HookPoint constants for HookAgentStart, HookAgentStep, HookAgentEnd are added to internal/gateway/hooks.go., Kernel fires HookAgentStart before entering the tool loop, HookAgentStep after each iteration, HookAgentEnd on exit., Tests prove hook callbacks receive HookEvent with agent_name, session_id, platform context.
- Not ready when: Hook errors abort the turn instead of being logged., The implementation adds hook points without corresponding kernel fire sites.
- Degraded mode: -
- Fixture: `-`
- Write scope: `internal/gateway/hooks.go`, `internal/gateway/hooks_test.go`, `internal/kernel/kernel.go`, `docs/content/building-gormes/architecture_plan/progress.json`
- Test commands: `go test ./internal/gateway -run 'HookAgent' -count=1`, `go test ./internal/kernel -run 'AgentLifecycle' -count=1`
- Done signal: go test ./internal/gateway ./internal/kernel -count=1 passes with agent lifecycle hook coverage., go run ./cmd/progress validate passes.
- Acceptance: HookAgentStart fires exactly once per agent turn, before any tool calls., HookAgentStep fires after each tool-batch outcome, carrying iteration index and tool result summary., HookAgentEnd fires exactly once per agent turn, even when the turn errors or hits iteration limit., All three hook points are exercised by gateway-level integration tests with fake hook callbacks.
- Source refs: ./hermes-agent/gateway/hooks.py:agent:start, agent:step, agent:end event types, ./hermes-agent/gateway/run.py:GatewayRunner._run_agent integration, internal/gateway/hooks.go:HookPoint, Hooks, internal/kernel/kernel.go:Run, processTurn, internal/kernel/toolexec.go:executeToolBatch
- Unblocks: Plugin/extension observation of agent turn boundaries, Tool-call audit hooks at agent step granularity, Agent completion telemetry and logging
- Why now: Unblocks Plugin/extension observation of agent turn boundaries, Tool-call audit hooks at agent step granularity, Agent completion telemetry and logging.

## 2. TD engineering blog scaffolded and live

- Phase: 8 / 8.A
- Owner: `docs`
- Size: `small`
- Status: `planned`
- Priority: `P1`
- Contract: TrebuchetDynamics has a publicly reachable engineering blog with a working Atom/RSS feed, an /about page that names the org and the methodology, and a deploy pipeline so a markdown commit becomes a published post without manual intervention. Hosting choice is owner's call (Astro/Hugo/Eleventy + Cloudflare/Vercel/GitHub Pages); the row is done when a stranger can subscribe to a feed and read one published post.
- Trust class: operator
- Ready when: Hosting choice and blog framework are decided (operator decision; not loop-driven)., A subdomain or path on an existing TD-controlled domain is available.
- Not ready when: The blog is private, password-protected, or behind authentication., There is no Atom/RSS feed at a stable URL., The first post is empty or placeholder text rather than the writeup #1 draft or a real introduction.
- Degraded mode: Without a publication outlet, every loop commit is invisible in the reputation market; the strategy described in success-plan.md cannot start.
- Fixture: `webpages/blog/ (or chosen blog repo path)`
- Write scope: `webpages/blog/ (or external blog repo path)`, `DNS / Cloudflare / hosting config (operator-only)`, `docs/content/building-gormes/architecture_plan/progress.json`
- Test commands: -
- No test required: Documentation/infrastructure row; success is the URL being live and the feed being reachable, validated by the acceptance checklist.
- Done signal: Public blog URL + feed URL recorded in success-plan.md and README.md.
- Acceptance: Blog is reachable at a public URL with at least one real (non-placeholder) post., An Atom or RSS feed exists at a stable, discoverable URL., Publishing a new post is a markdown-commit-and-merge operation; no console click-through required., An /about page exists that names TrebuchetDynamics and points at gormes-agent + agentic-porting-kit.
- Source refs: docs/content/building-gormes/strategy/success-plan.md, webpages/landing/
- Unblocks: Engineering writeup #1: autonomous Hermes-porting loop, Monthly digest pipeline
- Why now: Unblocks Engineering writeup #1: autonomous Hermes-porting loop, Monthly digest pipeline.

## 3. Behavioral pattern extraction from session logs

- Phase: 6 / 6.K
- Owner: `orchestrator`
- Size: `large`
- Status: `planned`
- Priority: `P3`
- Contract: Mine session logs and tool execution audits for behavioral patterns: which tool sequences succeed vs fail, which reasoning patterns precede good outcomes, which response styles correlate with user satisfaction. Patterns feed into the self-evolution loop as candidate mutations.
- Trust class: operator
- Ready when: Session logs are structured and queryable, Tool execution audit log exists (Phase 3.E.2)
- Not ready when: No structured session data available, Tool audit log not yet implemented
- Degraded mode: -
- Fixture: `-`
- Write scope: `internal/hermes/pattern_extractor.go`, `internal/hermes/pattern_extractor_test.go`
- Test commands: `go test ./internal/hermes -run TestPatternExtractor -count=1`
- Done signal: Pattern extractor tests prove successful and failed patterns are correctly identified from log data
- Acceptance: Pattern extractor identifies tool sequences with >80% success rate, Identifies tool sequences with <30% success rate (anti-patterns), Extracts reasoning patterns preceding successful tool calls, Patterns stored in Goncho as structured behavioral knowledge, Pattern extraction is offline (does not run during agent turns)
- Source refs: docs/content/papers/agentic-os-design.md, Hermes Agent GEPA engine, Generative Agents reflection mechanism (Park et al. 2023), internal/goncho/extractor.go, internal/hermes/turn.go
- Why now: Contract metadata is present; ready for a focused spec or fixture slice.

## 4. Agentic-porting-kit repo scaffold

- Phase: 8 / 8.E
- Owner: `skills`
- Size: `large`
- Status: `planned`
- Priority: `P2`
- Contract: The gormes-* skill set (gormes-planner, gormes-builder, gormes-tdd-slice, gormes-parity-auditor, gormes-references, gormes-skill-manager) is extracted into a separate public TrebuchetDynamics repo (`agentic-porting-kit` or equivalent), with a README that frames the kit as a generic Python→Go porting toolkit, a worked example using a small non-Hermes target, and a clear license. The kit must work standalone — its rows must be loadable by Codex or Claude Code in any repo, not just Gormes.
- Trust class: operator
- Ready when: All listed skills have a README of their own that does not assume the Gormes repo layout., Skills' references that hard-code Gormes paths have been parameterized or generalized.
- Not ready when: Skills still hard-code paths under docs/content/building-gormes/., The extracted kit cannot be tested without cloning Gormes.
- Degraded mode: Without extraction, the methodology is invisible to other teams; "the loop is the product" cannot be substantiated externally.
- Fixture: `(separate repo: TrebuchetDynamics/agentic-porting-kit)`
- Write scope: `(separate repo)`, `webpages/docs/development-skills/ (de-Gormes-fy paths)`, `docs/content/building-gormes/architecture_plan/progress.json`
- Test commands: -
- No test required: Cross-repo extraction; success is measured by the kit working standalone in a fresh checkout, not unit tests inside Gormes.
- Done signal: Repo URL recorded in success-plan.md and README.md; star count tracked monthly.
- Acceptance: Public repo TrebuchetDynamics/agentic-porting-kit exists with the listed skills., Repo README explains the kit independent of Gormes/Hermes., A worked example demonstrates the kit on a non-Hermes target (any small Python project being ported to Go)., Skills can be loaded into a fresh Codex or Claude Code session and successfully plan-and-execute one row in the example target.
- Source refs: docs/content/building-gormes/strategy/success-plan.md, webpages/docs/development-skills/gormes-planner/SKILL.md, webpages/docs/development-skills/gormes-builder/SKILL.md, webpages/docs/development-skills/gormes-tdd-slice/SKILL.md, webpages/docs/development-skills/gormes-parity-auditor/SKILL.md, webpages/docs/development-skills/gormes-references/SKILL.md, webpages/docs/development-skills/gormes-skill-manager/SKILL.md
- Why now: Contract metadata is present; ready for a focused spec or fixture slice.

## 5. Built-with-Gormes page scaffold

- Phase: 8 / 8.G
- Owner: `docs`
- Size: `small`
- Status: `planned`
- Priority: `P3`
- Contract: A page at gormes.ai/built-with (or equivalent path on the docs site) lists real production deployments of Gormes, even if there is initially only one entry (the operator's own). The page has a documented submission process (PR-based) and a template entry shape. The point is to make the slot exist so it can be filled, not to fake usage.
- Trust class: operator
- Ready when: Landing page exists., An entry template (yaml or md) is decided.
- Not ready when: Entries are fabricated., The submission process is unwritten.
- Degraded mode: Without the page, even genuine outside users have no place to land their name; reputation compounds through visibility.
- Fixture: `webpages/landing/src/pages/built-with.astro (or equivalent)`
- Write scope: `webpages/landing/src/`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `docs/content/building-gormes/architecture_plan/progress.json`
- Test commands: `(cd webpages/landing && npm run test:e2e)`, `go run ./cmd/progress validate`, `git diff --check`
- Done signal: Public page live with at least one truthful entry; submission process documented.
- Acceptance: /built-with (or chosen path) is reachable on the public landing site., The page renders at least one real entry (operator's own deployment, with truthful description)., A submission template + PR-based process is documented either inline on the page or in CONTRIBUTING.md.
- Source refs: docs/content/building-gormes/strategy/success-plan.md, webpages/landing/
- Why now: Contract metadata is present; ready for a focused spec or fixture slice.
