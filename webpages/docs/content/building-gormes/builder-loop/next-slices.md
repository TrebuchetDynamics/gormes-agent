# Next Slices

This page is generated from the canonical progress file and lists the highest
leverage contract-bearing roadmap rows to execute next.

The ordering is:

1. unblocked `P0` handoffs;
2. active `in_progress` rows;
3. `fixture_ready` rows;
4. unblocked rows that unblock other slices;
5. remaining `draft` contract rows.

Use this page when choosing implementation work. If a row is too broad, split
the row in `progress.json` before assigning it.

If no slices are listed, the next correct action is planner work: choose one
planned row from `progress.json` or a phase page and add enough contract detail
for it to appear here. Do not infer that an empty generated list means the
roadmap is complete.

<!-- PROGRESS:START kind=next-slices -->
| Phase | Slice | Contract | Trust class | Fixture | Why now |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 8 / 8.A | TD engineering blog scaffolded and live | TrebuchetDynamics has a publicly reachable engineering blog with a working Atom/RSS feed, an /about page that names the org and the methodology, and a deploy pipeline so a markdown commit becomes a published post without manual intervention. Hosting choice is owner's call (Astro/Hugo/Eleventy + Cloudflare/Vercel/GitHub Pages); the row is done when a stranger can subscribe to a feed and read one published post. | operator | `webpages/blog/ (or chosen blog repo path)` | Unblocks Engineering writeup #1: autonomous Hermes-porting loop, Monthly digest pipeline. |
| 8 / 8.E | Agentic-porting-kit repo scaffold | The gormes-* skill set (gormes-planner, gormes-builder, gormes-tdd-slice, gormes-parity-auditor, gormes-references, gormes-skill-manager) is extracted into a separate public TrebuchetDynamics repo (`agentic-porting-kit` or equivalent), with a README that frames the kit as a generic Python→Go porting toolkit, a worked example using a small non-Hermes target, and a clear license. The kit must work standalone — its rows must be loadable by Codex or Claude Code in any repo, not just Gormes. | operator | `(separate repo: TrebuchetDynamics/agentic-porting-kit)` | Contract metadata is present; ready for a focused spec or fixture slice. |
| 9 / 9.B | Sandbox provider interface and virtual path security | Gormes gains a sandbox provider abstraction layer over the existing tool execution environment (internal/tools/, internal/tools/environment_*.go, internal/tools/filesystem_scope.go), inspired by DeerFlow's SandboxProvider/Sandbox interface pair with virtual path security. The SandboxProvider interface defines acquire/get/release/shutdown lifecycle. A LocalSandboxProvider implementation provides filesystem-level isolation with per-thread virtual path mapping. The virtual path system uses a /mnt/user-data/{workspace,uploads,outputs} prefix that resolves to host paths with path-traversal rejection, path-family enforcement (read-only vs read-write), and output masking (host paths never leak into agent return values). Existing internal/tools/IsolationLevel (process/container/vm) and FilesystemScope continue to work — the sandbox provider wraps them rather than replacing them. | operator, system | `-` | Contract metadata is present; ready for a focused spec or fixture slice. |
