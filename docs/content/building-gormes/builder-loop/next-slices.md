# Next Slices

This page is generated from the canonical progress file and lists the highest
leverage contract-bearing roadmap rows to execute next.

The ordering is:

1. unblocked `P0` handoffs;
2. active `in_progress` rows;
3. `fixture_ready` rows;
4. unblocked rows that unblock other slices;
5. remaining `draft` contract rows.

Use this page when choosing implementation work. If a row is too broad, split
the row in `progress.json` before assigning it.

<!-- PROGRESS:START kind=next-slices -->
| Phase | Slice | Contract | Trust class | Fixture | Why now |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 7 / 7.E | Feishu transport/bootstrap layer | Gormes adds a fakeable Feishu/Lark transport bootstrap boundary before live SDK binding: config resolves app credentials, connection_mode selects webhook vs websocket, webhook URL verification and signature checks are pure helpers, websocket event handlers register message/reaction/card/customized processors, inbound events queue until the adapter loop is ready, and rich-text/card send failures return typed SendResult evidence with redacted tokens. | gateway, operator, system | `internal/channels/feishu/bootstrap_test.go` | Unblocks Feishu drive-comment rule + pairing seam, Feishu drive-comment reply workflow, Feishu live SDK binding. |
| 5 / 5.N | Clarify | Gormes ports Hermes clarify as a schema-validated, interruptible user-reply tool: required question text, up to four trimmed choices, platform-added Other behavior, callback/resume routing for gateway and TUI, deterministic unavailable output in non-interactive cron/oneshot contexts, and one-shot resume-token cleanup after the next user reply. | operator, gateway, child-agent, system | `internal/tools/clarify_tool_test.go; internal/gateway/clarify_resume_test.go` | Contract metadata is present; ready for a focused spec or fixture slice. |
