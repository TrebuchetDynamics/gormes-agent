# Agent Queue

This page is generated from the canonical progress file:
`docs/content/building-gormes/architecture_plan/progress.json`.

It lists unblocked, non-umbrella contract rows that are ready for a focused
skill-driven implementation attempt. Each card carries the execution owner,
slice size, contract, trust class, degraded-mode requirement, fixture target,
write scope, test commands, done signal, acceptance checks, and source
references.

Shared skill handoff facts live in [Skill Builder Handoff](../builder-loop-handoff/):
the main skill entrypoint, plan, candidate source, generated docs, tests, and
candidate policy. Keep those control-plane facts in `meta.builder_loop`, and
keep row-specific execution facts in `progress.json`.

If the generated list is empty, do not switch to an ad hoc TODO list. Route
through `gormes-planner`, repair one planned/draft row until it satisfies the
handoff contract, validate `progress.json`, and then return to builder
selection.

## 1. Sandbox isolation depth selection

- Phase: 5 / 5.U
- Owner: `tools`
- Size: `medium`
- Status: `planned`
- Priority: `P3`
- Contract: Operator can select sandbox isolation depth: process-level (fast, weaker isolation), container-level (Docker/gVisor, balanced), or VM-level (Firecracker, strongest isolation). Default is process-level with transactional rollback.
- Trust class: operator
- Ready when: Transactional executor exists (5.U row 2)
- Not ready when: No sandbox backend available
- Degraded mode: -
- Fixture: `-`
- Write scope: `internal/tools/isolation_depth.go`, `internal/tools/isolation_depth_test.go`
- Test commands: `go test ./internal/tools -run TestIsolationDepth -count=1`
- Done signal: Isolation depth tests prove all three levels selectable and process-level works without Docker
- Acceptance: Process-level isolation is the default and requires zero setup, Docker/gVisor isolation selectable via config, Firecracker VM isolation selectable via config, Isolation depth is per-session configurable, Deeper isolation correctly fails if backend not available
- Source refs: docs/content/papers/safety-and-deployment.md, OpenSandbox (github.com/alibaba/OpenSandbox), internal/tools/sandbox.go
- Why now: Contract metadata is present; ready for a focused spec or fixture slice.

## 2. Behavioral pattern extraction from session logs

- Phase: 6 / 6.K
- Owner: `orchestrator`
- Size: `large`
- Status: `planned`
- Priority: `P3`
- Contract: Mine session logs and tool execution audits for behavioral patterns: which tool sequences succeed vs fail, which reasoning patterns precede good outcomes, which response styles correlate with user satisfaction. Patterns feed into the self-evolution loop as candidate mutations.
- Trust class: operator
- Ready when: Session logs are structured and queryable, Tool execution audit log exists (Phase 3.E.2)
- Not ready when: No structured session data available, Tool audit log not yet implemented
- Degraded mode: -
- Fixture: `-`
- Write scope: `internal/hermes/pattern_extractor.go`, `internal/hermes/pattern_extractor_test.go`
- Test commands: `go test ./internal/hermes -run TestPatternExtractor -count=1`
- Done signal: Pattern extractor tests prove successful and failed patterns are correctly identified from log data
- Acceptance: Pattern extractor identifies tool sequences with >80% success rate, Identifies tool sequences with <30% success rate (anti-patterns), Extracts reasoning patterns preceding successful tool calls, Patterns stored in Goncho as structured behavioral knowledge, Pattern extraction is offline (does not run during agent turns)
- Source refs: docs/content/papers/agentic-os-design.md, Hermes Agent GEPA engine, Generative Agents reflection mechanism (Park et al. 2023), internal/goncho/extractor.go, internal/hermes/turn.go
- Why now: Contract metadata is present; ready for a focused spec or fixture slice.
